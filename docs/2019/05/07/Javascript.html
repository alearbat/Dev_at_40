<p>I learned a little of HTML, a little of CSS and finally the moment have arrived! I really enjoy learning new things, so I’m very excited about studying Javascript. I talked with many people and they say is very important to know JS, because is the base of everything for a front-end developer. It’s not recommended to start studying any frameworks, until you have at least a clear idea of JavaScript. 
So, in this case, I decided to start with FreeCodeCamp tutorials. I think FCC is one of the best websites to learn… I feel very comfortable with it. Also, Andres told me about Javascript30, which is a combo of 30 day’s video tutorials (1 exercise per day), so I’m practicing with that too.
Javascript isn’t as easy as I expected… so I must stay focused with this to continue learning in a reasonable speed.
I’m also picking some shuffle exercises from internet to achieve little goals.
For example, this one… I have a surprise for you:</p>
