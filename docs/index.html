            <h2>STARTING A NEW LIFE</h2>
            <h3>April 01, 2019</h3>
            <p><p>You’re 40. Maybe things didn’t go as you thought in your professional life… or maybe they did, but you think you need a change. You know becoming a developer has a lot of benefits, but you also have some fears: is it possible to change my career being 40 years old? Is it too difficult to learn coding? Will I be able to find a new job as a Junior-Dev? Where must I start? Which is the best way to study?… and the list continues…</p>

<p>I believe you must follow your instinct and your passions! Enjoy learning, plan a path, stay focused and you’ll achieve whatever you want.</p>

<p>In this blog you will find a lot of information, advice, stories and links that will help you to reach your goal. <strong>Go for it!</strong></p>
