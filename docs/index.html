            <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
            <h3>May 07, 2019</h3>
            <p><p>I learned a little of HTML, a little of CSS and finally the moment have arrived! I really enjoy learning new things, so I’m very excited about studying Javascript. I talked with many people and they say is very important to know JS, because is the base of everything for a front-end developer. It’s not recommended to start studying any frameworks, until you have at least a clear idea of JavaScript. 
So, in this case, I decided to start with FreeCodeCamp tutorials. I think FCC is one of the best websites to learn… I feel very comfortable with it. Also, Andres told me about Javascript30, which is a combo of 30 day’s video tutorials (1 exercise per day), so I’m practicing with that too.
Javascript isn’t as easy as I expected… so I must stay focused with this to continue learning in a reasonable speed.
I’m also picking some shuffle exercises from internet to achieve little goals.
For example, this one… I have a surprise for you:</p>
</p>
          </li>
          
              <button class="button_gift" type="button" onclick="myGift()"><i id="button_gift" class="fas fa-chevron-down fa-rotate-270"></i></i></button>
              <p id="gift"></p>
          
        
          <li>
            <h2>WHERE TO BEGIN</h2>
            <h3>April 15, 2019</h3>
            <p><p>You already took the decision… and now? Where to begin?</p>
</p>
          </li>
          
        
          <li>
            <h2>STARTING A NEW LIFE</h2>
            <h3>April 01, 2019</h3>
            <p><p>You’re 40. Maybe things didn’t go as you thought in your professional life… or maybe they did, but you think you need a change. You know becoming a developer has a lot of benefits, but you also have some fears: is it possible to change my career being 40 years old? Is it too difficult to learn coding? Will I be able to find a new job as a Junior-Dev? Where must I start? Which is the best way to study?… and the list continues…</p>

<p>I believe you must follow your instinct and your passions! Enjoy learning, plan a path, stay focused and you’ll achieve whatever you want.</p>

<p>In this blog you will find a lot of information, advice, stories and links that will help you to reach your goal. <strong>Go for it!</strong></p>
